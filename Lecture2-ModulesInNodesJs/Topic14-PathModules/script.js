console.log("learning about path module");

// (path) module:It is used to work with the file-system on our computer or machine:
// V.IMP: It is a core module in node js, so we don't need to install it separately:
// V.IMP-NOTE:path-module basically help us to define the paths for the file-system:In such way that our file-system can easily understand the path of the file which we are trying to access:With in the any form of operating-system or machine:because every operating-system or machine has its own way of defining the path for the file-system:that why we need to use path-module to define the paths for the file-system:so that our application can easily understand the path of the file which we are trying to access and did not get crashed:


// here we learn about the path module:
// -> Import (fs-module):because it works with it:
const fs = require("fs");
// -> Import (path-module):we gonna learn to use it with the (fs-module):
const path = require("path");

// we can understand with the help of example:like we want to read some file from the another folder:
// -> first:we gonna check the simple-way of defining path to the file-system:why simply defining the (directory-path) through (string) to the file-system:

const readingFile = fs.readFile('./src/database/data.txt','utf-8',(err,data)=>{
    if(err){
        console.log('error while reading the file:',err);
    }else{
        console.log('data from simple-path method:',data);
    }
});

// -> second:we gonna check about that how we can define the (path) of the file-system with the help of (path-module):
// IMP:there are different method available in the (path-module):
// -> 1 = (join) method:It is used to join the (path) of the file-system:
// -> 2 = (resolve) method:It is used to resolve the (path) of the file-system:
// -> 3 = (dirname) method:It is used to get the (directory-path) of the file-system:
// -> 4 = (basename) method:It is used to get the (base-path) of the file-system:
// -> 5 = (extname) method:It is used to get the (extension) of the (path) of the file-system:
// -> 6 = (__dirname) is a global-variable not a (method): in Node.js that returns the path of the current working directory.

// => 1 =  Learning To Use (Join) method:

// Steps To Follow:
// IMP-1: so for defining-path to the (fs) with the help of (path-module):first we have to define the path separately:because we can't directly define the path to the (fs) with the help of (path-module): and path-module does not work that way because for creating path using (path-module) we need to use (methods) of (path-module):
// that's why we have to define the path separately:we gonna define the path separately with in the const-variable:and then we can use that (path-variable) to define the path into the file-system:

// IMP-2:these methods of path-module:basically define the (path) in such-way that they can be easily understand by the any operating-system or machine's file-system:and this is but we want to achieve and but (path) module does:
// -> so for creating path using (path-module):we have its (join) method:which is used to join the (path) of the file-system:

// -> V.IMP-NOTE:how does join-method works:Joining-paths in a file system means putting different parts of a (file) or (folder) path together to make one (complete-path):
// -> V.IMP-NOTE:the (join) method only provide,create or return the (path):acc to which number of path-parts we have provided to it:
// -> V.IMP-NOTE:what join-method does is that:When we use a path-joining function:it automatically uses the [correct-symbol] for the (file-path) acc to the operating-system:
// Creating Path Using Join-Method:
// -> we can create those diff-parts of the path through or with the help of (string):
// -> and for creating difference between those path-parts we are going to use the (,) comma-symbol:


const joinPath = path.join('src','database','data.txt');
console.log('join path',joinPath);
// -> IMP-3:after creating path:we simply have to pass that path to the (fs) to define the path with in the file-system:which we have stored with in the (variable):

const readFileData = fs.readFile(joinPath,'utf-8',function(err,data){
    if(err){
        console.log('error while reading the file:',err);
    }else{
        console.log('data from path-module methods1:',data);
    }
})


// => 2 = Learn To Use (Resolve) method:
// It also work in the same way as the (join) method:it also implement in the same-way as the (join) method:but only the difference is that it provide us the path in the different form:
// V.IMP-NOTE:the (resolve) method basically provide,create or return we can say the (hole) path of the file-system:acc to the (path) that we have provided to it:
// -> It basically return the (path) from the (root) directory to till which we have provide to it of the operating-system or machine:
// IMP-NOTE:And this path is known as (absolute-path):

const resolvePath = path.resolve('src','database','data.txt');
console.log('resolve path',resolvePath);

const readFileData1 = fs.readFile(resolvePath,'utf-8',function(err,data){
    if(err){
        console.log('error while reading the file:',err);
    }else{
        console.log('data from path-module methods2:',data);
    }
})


// => 3 = (extname) method:It is used to get the (extension) of the (path) of the file-system:
// It method help us in finding the (extension) of the (path) of the file-system:like we if we have (txt) extension in the last of the (path) of the file-system:then we can use this (extname) method:To get extension-name:
const extensionName = path.extname(resolvePath);
console.log('extension name',extensionName);

// => 4 = (dirname) method:It is used to get the (directory-path) of the file-system:
// The dirname method in the path module is used to get the directory-part of a file path. It extracts the part of the path that points to the folder-containing the file, leaving out the file name itself.
const directoryName = path.dirname(resolvePath);
console.log('directory name',directoryName);


// => 5[V.IMP-Topic] = (__dirname) is a global-variable it is not a method: In Node.js it returns the path of the current-working-directory:
// Important Notes:
// __dirname is a global variable that gives you the directory name of the current file or module.
// It provides the full path to the directory where your script or module is located.
// This means you can use __dirname to easily access other files and folders in the same directory without needing to specify their paths manually.
// With __dirname, you donâ€™t have to define the file path every time; it helps you access the directory and its contents directly.
