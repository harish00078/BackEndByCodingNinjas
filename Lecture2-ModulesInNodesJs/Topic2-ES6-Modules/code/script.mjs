// ==> In This:- Topic-file we are gonna be learn about (ES6 Module syntax):

// V.V.IMP = In ES6-modules syntax we basically use the (export) keyword simply to export things or modules we can say from one file to another file:

// => ES6 Module:The ES6 module syntax is a more modern approach that is supported by modern JavaScript environments or we can say by the (Libraries) and (Frameworks): and it uses the "import" and "export" keywords:
// V.IMP = For this approach we did not have to create the module.exports object:we can simply export our function or anything that we want to export as a module by using the (export) keyword in (front) of them or (after) them:
// V.IMP = we have use this (module) method or syntax with in our (react) learnings:

// V.V.IMP(NOTE) = so when we are using the (ES6) module-syntax:To (import) and (export) Modules from one file to another file:Mostly when we are creating the application simply using (nodejs) environment or we can say without the help of any (frameworks) and (libraries):then we have to use the (mjs) extension in the file-name:instead of using simple (js) extension:
// because In this case:if we use the simple (js) extension:then our application code will not gonna get executed:

// V.IMP: So when we are working with the (ES6) module syntax:then we can also create the things in multiple-ways:And also we can also export them in multiple-ways:

// for-example: if we are creating the (functions):
// so there are multiple-way to create them and then export them:with the help of (ES6) module syntax:
// [First-type]: Simple-Functions:means those functions which has been created using the (function) keyword:
// IMP-NOTE:If we wanna export it:using (ES6) module syntax:then we simply have to use the (export) keyword in front of (function) or (thing) which we wanna exported:
export function multiple(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}

// [Second-type]: Arrow-Functions:means those function which we are not created using the (function) keywords:they are created using the (arrow-functions) method:
// IMP: Same thing we have to do with it:if we want to export it:using (ES6) module syntax:then we simply have to use the (export) keyword in front of (function) or (thing) which we wanna exported:
// V.IMP-NOTE:Here we have one thing also:if we are using the (arrow-functions) directly with the (export) keyword:then we have to create the arrow-function (variable-name) through the help of (variable-declaration) keyword:like (const) mostly which we use to declare the (variable):
// because here we did not use the dot (.) keyword to assign the (function) and (things) or we can say there (variable-name) to the (exported) keyword:like we did in the (commonjs) syntax:

export const sum = (x, y) => {
  return x + y;
};

// (IMP-NOTE) = When we export something (like a function) from one file and import it in another, the entire file with the export runs once when itâ€™s imported. After that, any further imports use the already executed file:
// However, only the parts we specifically import are accessible in the importing file:which we are basically exporting from one file to another file:
// IMP-NOTE: In ES6 modules, this process is slightly different because of tree-shaking approach. Tree-shaking removes unused code, so only the parts that are actually used are included in the final output, making the code smaller and more efficient.
// [Tree shaking]: It's a term used in JavaScript for dead code elimination. It's a process that removes unused code from your final bundle, resulting in smaller and faster applications. Tree shaking relies heavily on the static structure of ES6 modules (import and export statements). This allows bundlers to analyze your code and determine which parts are actually used:
