// (FS)-File System Module:It basically allows us to work with the file system on our computer or machine:
// V.IMP: We can use it to read, write, delete, update (data) in files and folders on our computer:It also help us to move our files and folders on the computer:
// V.IMP-NOTE:Working with file-system is basically a (input-output) operation:because (fs) is also managed by the other system which is the operating system: so it is an input-output operation:because it has to interact with the operating system to perform the operations:
// IMP-NOTE: It is a core module in node js, so we don't need to install it separately:

// we have two-ways to use (fs) module in (nodejs):
// -> 1 = synchronous-way:
// -> 2 = asynchronous-way:
// Synchronous:It means that the code will be executed in a sequence, one after the other:It is blocking code, which means that the code will be executed in a sequential manner:
// Asynchronous:It means that the code will be executed in a non-sequential manner;It is non-blocking code, which means that the code will be executed in a non-sequential manner:
