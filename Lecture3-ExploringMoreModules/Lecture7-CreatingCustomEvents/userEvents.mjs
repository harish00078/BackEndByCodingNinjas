/*
 * Understanding Event-Driven Architecture through an example:
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 * -> We are receiving a post from a user and want to handle it using events or (event-driven architecture).
 * -> To achieve this, we can create custom-events that allow us to process user posts in (event-driven) architecture-way or asynchronous-way.
 * -> With custom events, we can perform multiple-operations on a post by simply adding multiple event-listeners to it.
 * -> V.IMP: This modular approach ensures that each operation runs independently without blocking the main thread.
 *
 * ✅ Key Benefit: Event-driven architecture improves performance and scalability by handling events asynchronously.

// Creating Custom Events in an Event-Driven Architecture
// -------------------------------------------------------

/*
 * In Node.js, we use the built-in ['events'] module to create and handle custom-events.
 * -> The 'events' module provides an 'EventEmitter' class that allows us to create custom-events.
 * -> IMP: The 'EventEmitter' class is the core of the 'events' module.
 * The 'EventEmitter' class provides methods like 'emit()' to trigger an event: and 'on()' to listen for those events.
 *
 * -> 1: Importing 'EventEmitter' using CommonJS syntax:we can directly import the EventEmitter class from the events module.
 * const EventEmitter = require("events").EventEmitter;
 *
 * IMP:Or we can import the (module) first:and then latter access its (EventEmitter) class with in our own-created class:through which we are emitting the events:by extending or connecting it with the (EventEmitter) class of (events) module.
 * // example:if we are importing the (event) only using (CommonJS) syntax:
 * const events = require("events");
 * class UserEvents extends events.EventEmitter  {
 * // class body
 * }
 *
 * -> 2: Importing 'EventEmitter' using ES6 syntax:
 */
import { EventEmitter } from "events";

/*
 * -> V.IMP:For creating custom-events:we have to create our own-class that extends or connects with  the 'EventEmitter' class.
 * -> through which we can (emit) thing of (class) as a (event) and (listen) to it as well.by the (methods) of the (EventEmitter) class.
 * This allows us to create custom-events and handle them in an event-driven manner.
 * -> IMP:for connecting or inheriting the two classes:we have to use the (extends) keyword.
 */
// we also have to export the class in (ES6) syntax-way:if we are Importing the things in (ES6) syntax-way as well:
export class UserEvents extends EventEmitter {
  /*
   * The 'createPost' method allows a user to create a post.
   * -> When a post is created, the 'postCreated' event is emitted.
   * -> This allows other parts of the application to listen for and react to this event.
   */
  createPost(content) {
    console.log("User Created Post:", content);

    /*
     * IMPORTANT NOTE: After receiving a (POST) request or (data) from the user,
     * we pass the received (post) to the (UserEvents) class, which extends or connect with the (EventEmitter) class:
     * 
     * =>V.IMP-NOTE: we are able to do that by creating the (object) of the (UserEvents) class.
     * and through that (object) we can access the properties (function,methods and etc) of the class:and with in those properties we are basically emitting the events:
     * 
     * 
     * Using this mechanism:
     * - We can (emit) the (post) as an (event) to other parts of the application.
     * - We can (listen) for the (event) and execute asynchronous (actions) on the (post).
     * This approach follows event-driven architecture principles, enhancing modularity and efficiency.
     */

    /*
     * => (emit) method is used to trigger an event.
     * -> It takes two arguments:
     * -> The first argument is the (event-name) ('postCreated').
     * -> The second argument is the post (content).
     */
    // IMP-NOTE:[this] refers to the current-instance or object of the class.
    this.emit("postCreated", content);
  }
}

/*
 * ✅ Summary:
 * -> We created a class 'UserEvents' that extends 'EventEmitter' to handle user posts as events.
 * -> The 'createPost' method emits a 'postCreated' event whenever a user creates a post.
 * -> Other parts of the application can listen for this event and perform actions asynchronously.
 * -> This approach follows event-driven architecture principles, making the application more modular and efficient.
