// IMP-NOTE:Understand it through an example:
// -> we are getting the (post) from the (user):and we wanna handle through the (events) or (event-driven-architecture):
// -> so,we can create the (custom-events) for that:and through that (custom-events) we can handle the (post) from the (user):
// -> through that (custom-event) we can do the (multiple-operations) on that (post) by simply creating the multiple (event-listeners) for that:
// V.IMP:It help us to handle the (post) from the (user) in a (modular-way) or in a (asynchronous-way):that what event-driven-architecture is all about or help us do:To handle things in a modular-way or in a asynchronous-way:
