// IMP: Here we are importing the (UserEvents) class from the (userEvents.mjs) file.
// This class helps us represent that a (post) has been created by the (user) and emit it as an event.
import { UserEvents } from "./userEvents.mjs";

// IMP: We can achieve this by creating an instance (or object) of the UserEvents-class.  
// This instance or object will be responsible for emitting the post as an event.  

// V.IMP-NOTE: We utilize the properties of the UserEvents-class to emit the post as an event through that (instance) or (object):  
// These properties are defined within the UserEvents-class, allowing us to trigger and handle events efficiently.
const user = new UserEvents(); 

// Function to simulate saving the post to a database.
// This function will execute when the "postCreated" event is triggered.
function saveToDatabase() {
    console.log("Post Saved To Database:");
}

// Function to simulate sending a notification to users.
// This function will be triggered when a new post is created.
function sendNotification() {
    console.log("Notification Sent:");
}

// Function to simulate updating the userâ€™s timeline.
// When a new post is created, this function updates the user's timeline accordingly.
function updateTimeLine(){
    console.log("TimeLine Updated:");
}

// IMP: Here we are listening to the (postCreated) event and handling it through multiple event listeners.
// Whenever the (postCreated) event is emitted, the registered event listeners (functions) will execute in order.
user.addListener("postCreated", saveToDatabase);
user.addListener("postCreated", sendNotification);
user.addListener("postCreated", updateTimeLine);


// V.IMP-NOTE: Here we got the (post) from the (user):through the help of (request) method.
// -> after getting the (post)
user.createPost('hey we have new post from the user');
