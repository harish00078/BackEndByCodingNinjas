// IMP: Here we are importing the (UserEvents) class from the (userEvents.mjs) file.
// This class helps us represent that a (post) has been created by the (user) and emit it as an event.
import { UserEvents } from "./userEvents.mjs";

// IMP: We can achieve this by creating an instance (or object) of the UserEvents-class.  
// This instance or object will be responsible for emitting the post as an event.  

// V.IMP-NOTE: We utilize the properties of the UserEvents-class to emit the post as an event through that (instance) or (object):  
// These properties are defined within the UserEvents-class, allowing us to trigger and handle events efficiently:
// ->IMP:for creating the (instance) or (object) of the (UserEvents-class):we are using the (new) keyword to do that.
// ->IMP:Here we are creating the (instance) of the (UserEvents-class) and storing it in the (user) variable.
// ->IMP:This (instance) will be responsible for emitting the (post) as an event. 
const user = new UserEvents(); 

// Function to simulate saving the post to a database.
// This function will execute when the "postCreated" event is triggered.
function saveToDatabase() {
    console.log("Post Saved To Database:");
}

// Function to simulate sending a notification to users.
// This function will be triggered when a new post is created.
function sendNotification() {
    console.log("Notification Sent:");
}

// Function to simulate updating the userâ€™s timeline.
// When a new post is created, this function updates the user's timeline accordingly.
function updateTimeLine(){
    console.log("TimeLine Updated:");
}

// IMP: Here we are listening to the (postCreated) event and handling it through multiple event listeners.
// Whenever the (postCreated) event is emitted, the registered event listeners (functions) will execute in order.
// V.IMP:for listening to the (postCreated) event:we are using the (addListener) method of (nodejs):
user.addListener("postCreated", saveToDatabase);
user.addListener("postCreated", sendNotification);
user.addListener("postCreated", updateTimeLine);


// V.IMP-NOTE: Here we got the (post) from the (user):through the help of (http-request) method.
// -> after getting the (post) from the (user):we have to emit the (post) as an event:
// -> IMP: for that we have to use the (properties) of the (object):which we created from the (UserEvents-class):and where we have defined the (properties) to emit the (post) as an event.
// -> IMP: Here we are using the (createPost) method to emit the (post) as an event.
// -> IMP: This method will emit the (post) as an event and will trigger all the event listeners that are listening to the (postCreated) event.
user.createPost('hey we have new post from the user');
